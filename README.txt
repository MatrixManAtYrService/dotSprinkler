This is M@'s roaming configuration. It is provided as is (aren't most things?).  The only "particular purpose" it is warrantied to be "fit" for is taking up space in memory somewhere.  You can do whatever you like with it, but if you redistribute it you should remove his name from this file so that this README can't be used to track down the original author in the event that it grows up to become Skynet.  Also, please don't encourage its growing up to become Skynet.

If you're on a debian-style system, run 'sudo ./bootstrap.sh' to configure everything M@'s way (it requires apt-get, and later calls .configure.sh)
If you're not, run './configure.sh' to perform the non-apt-getty stuff.
